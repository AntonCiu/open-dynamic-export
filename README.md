## About

This project aims to implement dynamic export control using Node.js/TypeScript implementing SEP2/IEEE 2030.5-2018/AS 5385:2023 (utility connection) and SunSpec Modbus (inverter connection) to satisfy the dynamic connections requirement of various Austrailan energy markets.   

The initial implementation focuses on the Energy Queensland requirements as outlined in the [SEP2 Client Handbook published by Energy Queensland](https://www.energex.com.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/1072618/SEP2-Client-Handbook-13436740.pdf).
